# Greenscreen MLO for FiveM servers
## Caution
This mod is not made by me, it is made by Michno (https://forum.cfx.re/u/michno/summary). I further modified the files to make it work as a addon MLO.

## Usage
Just put this resource folder into your server, I recommend creating a new category (like [custommaps]) to keep the folders tidy.
After that, execute `/tp 40.45, 680.64, 361.46` to see the MLO.
